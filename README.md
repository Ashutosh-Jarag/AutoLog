# ðŸš€ AutoLog Frontend             "https://autolog-app.onrender.com/"

## ðŸŒŸ What I Built
I crafted the frontend for AutoLog, a smart vehicle logging system, using **Create React App** to kickstart a fast, responsive web dashboard. My work focused on building a sleek interface with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, to display real-time vehicle logs and fare calculations. I integrated APIs from the FastAPI backend to fetch and visualize data, creating an intuitive experience for admins managing parking areas or entry gates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Itâ€™s Cool
This frontend makes AutoLogâ€™s vehicle tracking seamless and visually appealing. It connects to a backend to show live data, like license plates and entry times, in a dashboard thatâ€™s easy to navigate, helping parking management go from manual chaos to automated clarity.

# 🚗 AutoLog: Smart Vehicle Logging System               "https://autolog-app.onrender.com/"

## 🎯 What I Built
I developed AutoLog, a smart vehicle logging system that automates monitoring for parking areas and entry gates. My work focused on integrating camera-based detection with AI-driven image processing and OCR to capture vehicle details like license plates, types, and timestamps. I built a FastAPI backend to handle real-time data, stored it in a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database, and created a React-based web dashboard for admins to view logs and manage fares. This project eliminates manual tracking, reduces errors, and enhances parking efficiency.

## 💡 Why It Matters
AutoLog replaces slow, error-prone manual vehicle logging with an intelligent, automated solution. It uses AI to log data instantly, stores it securely in the cloud, and presents it through a user-friendly dashboard, making parking management faster and more transparent for residential, commercial, and smart city use cases.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Image Processing**: LLM model + traditional image processing for vehicle detection and OCR
- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (cloud-hosted)
- **Cloud**: Cloud storage for real-time, secure data access

## ✨ Key Features
- 🚀 **Automated Logging**: Captures vehicle identity, type, and timestamps using AI and OCR
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Access**: View logs instantly via a web dashboard
- 💸 **Fare Calculation**: Automates parking fees based on duration
- 🔒 **Cloud Storage**: Securely stores data for scalability
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly UI**: Clean, responsive dashboard for admins

## 🖱️ How It Works
- Upload or stream camera footage to detect vehicles
- AI processes images to extract license plates and vehicle types
- Data is logged in PostgreSQL and stored in the cloud
- Admins view real-time logs and fare calculations on the React dashboard
